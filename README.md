## General info
I built this swift package so I could avoid importing any large libraries like Alamofie as most my projects
need a simple networking layer over URLSession and Combine.

## Installation

### [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) (for Apple platforms only)

In Xcode, select _File_ > _Swift Packages_ > _Add Package Dependency_ and enter the repository URL:

```

```
## Status
Project is: _in progress_. Might add more options in the furture but this is version 1.0.0
